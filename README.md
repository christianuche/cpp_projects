# Overview

This project is my ongoing effort in building a good professional software portfolio as I progress and improve my skills as a software developer. This program goal is to demonstrate an understanding of c++ syntax with the ability to compile and run a simple application.

I wrotte this code to ensure that my development environ is correctly set up and ready to practice the workflow of writing, compiling, compiling and documenting software programs. It is also going to help me in establishing my GitHub workflow for future, more difficult or complex projects.

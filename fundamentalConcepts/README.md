# Overview

As a software engineer in Brigham Young University, I'm working to build a strong foundation in core programming concepts by practicing with languages like C++. This project demonstrates my understanding of C++ syntax and structure, as well as my ability to apply basic programming constructs to solve common problems.

The software I developed is a C++ program that showcases a wide range of features including variables, data types, arithmetic operations, control flow (if/else, switch), loops (for and while), functions, vectors, string manipulation, sorting, and basic exception handling. It did not end but also includes user-defined functions for calculating the area of a circle and determining the maximum of two numbers.

My primary purpose in writing this program was to gain hands-on experience with the C++ language and reinforce my understanding of how its syntax and core features work in practice. This program serves as both a coding exercise and a personal reference for foundational C++ programming techniques.

# Future Work

- Add user input instead of hardcoded values for greater interactivity
- Create a menu-driven interface for selecting different program features
- Implement file input/output (I/O) for saving and loading data
- Explore object-oriented programming by introducing classes
- Add more robust error checking and edge case handling

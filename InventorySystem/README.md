# Overview

This project is my ongoing effort in building a good professional software portfolio as I progress and improve my skills as a software developer. This program goal is to demonstrate an understanding of c++ syntax with the ability to compile and run a simple application. This program is a step to building software that can solve world problem. It is also going to help me in establishing my GitHub workflow for future, more difficult or complex projects.
